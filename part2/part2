First create Module name my_timer
with Proc entry /proc/timer.

Goals: Display current time in seconds + fractional part for nanoseconds).
       Elapsed time since the last read, if can be done(meaning is not first read)

Some Ideas:
  On insmod my_timer.ko, the /proc/timer entry is created.
On rmmod my_timer.ko, the /proc/timer entry is removed.

Each time we read /proc/timer:
  Show the current time in a format like X.YYYYYYYYY, where X is seconds and Y is nanoseconds.
  If this is not the very first read, we can print how much time has elapsed since the previous read in the same format( this could be trickier).


Approach Process:
  Gotta define a global/static var like struct
